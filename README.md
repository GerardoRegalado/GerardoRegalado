<h2> My name is Gerardo Regalado </h2>

<h4> <p>I like to leave a little piece of myself in each project. </p>

Enthusiast of science, technology and mathematics. I try to always be up to date and well informed of everything that happens in my work and personal environment.

I really enjoy programming with a cup of coffee and a good podcast or sometimes a good playlist can be the perfect company to forget about frustration and let creativity flow in the face of any kind of challenge.
